 THIS IS NOW OPEN SOURCE! If you want to contribute to the callout pack, DM me through discord so I can

 JM Callouts Remastered is the remastered callout pack from the original JM Callouts BETA 
pack previously uploaded to LSPDFR.com. This callout pack will have the best callouts that I ever done. Expect a lot from this pack.
